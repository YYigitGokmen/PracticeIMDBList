# PracticeIMDBList
Patika+ Fullstack Bootcamp PracticeIMDBList


Let's create a list where we will list the Movies.

Properties for the movie -> Imdb Score (Double) - Name 

By asking the user for an unlimited number of movie names and IMDb scores, objects will be created and the list will be filled with this information.

 After each movie addition, the user will be asked if he/she wants to add a new movie. If the user answers yes, the loop goes back to the beginning, a new movie is created and transferred to the relevant list. If the answer is no, the program should be terminated by presenting the following outputs separately.

-> At the end of the application

 All movies should be listed.

 All movies with IMDb scores between 4 and 9 should be listed.

 List movies whose names start with 'A' and their IMDb scores.
